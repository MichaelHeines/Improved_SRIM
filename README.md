# Improved_SRIM

SRIM analysis code with higher stability and readability

The main focus of these changes is on the FNM analysis. This has to be used in combination with SRIM
The NRA files have not been optimized as much as I would like

DISCLAIMER: This code was written for the analysis of an experimental campaign at CERN-MEDICIS. The author cannot be held responsible for any shortcomings of the code.
